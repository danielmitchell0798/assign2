        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Mitchell. I do play video games in my past time and I do mainly read most of the time.</p>
        <aside>On a side note, I do have days where I don't talk a lot (like now), so I don't have any witty snarks to blazle here.</aside>
        <p>I mainly read Fanfiction stories that usually occupy my interest to the point that I usually do most of my work until the last four hours of each night, so yay me.</p>

        <h1>Education <small> (I swear, I said "Ed-you-cat-ee-on" instead of "Education")</small></h1>
        <p>Now, when you say education, do you mean where we were beforehand, or what we are going into? Because I see it is more of the second than the first.<br>If so, then I am going into Computer Science Major with a focus on more game programming.</p>
        <p>I was originally from MWSU (same major) as a freshman before hopping over to UNO for costs, me being slightly anti-social, and I don't like the dorm life.</p>
